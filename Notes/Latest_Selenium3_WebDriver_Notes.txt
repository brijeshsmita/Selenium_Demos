You are using latest version of Selenium WebDriver i.e. Selenium 3.x, this version of webdriver doesn't support direct firefox launch. You have to set the SystemProperty for webdriver.gecko.driver.

Replace the Code:-

WebDriver driver;
driver =new FirefoxDriver();
With This code:-

WebDriver driver;
System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "<Path to your WebDriver>");
driver =new FirefoxDriver();
